Demo app of "The QVII"

"The QVII" game, hosted on theqvii.com, is proprietary - however this github repo is available to share mechanics from the "Play" part of the game. Other mechanics including the JSON structure used in the game and PNG assets modeled after the game are also available. Like this demo app, the QVII game itself functions through Plotly Dash and Dash Core Components (DCC) specifically.
